# RETRO WHEELS | Premium Automotive Archive

## 📖 About The Project

**Retro Wheels** is an immersive, dynamic image gallery built with React.js, dedicated to golden-era automobiles.

This project goes beyond a standard photo gallery by implementing a high-fidelity vintage aesthetic—complete with CRT texture overlays, retro typography, and a cinematic video header—while maintaining modern responsiveness and interactivity. It demonstrates proficiency in React hooks, state management, component architecture, and advanced CSS styling.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🎬 Cinematic Video Header:** A full-screen (on mobile), responsive video introduction that sets the vintage tone immediately.
* **🧭 Dynamic Sticky Navigation:** A navigation bar that stays hidden to maximize the hero view, automatically sliding into place as the user scrolls down.
* **🗂️ Interactive Filtering & Search:** Instantly filter the archive by categories (Muscle, Classic, Sports, Race) or search by car name in real-time.
* **♥ "My Garage" Collection System:** Users can "Save" cars to their personal garage. This data is persisted using the browser's **LocalStorage**, saving their collection even after a refresh.
* **📱 Fully Responsive Layout:** Utilizes CSS Grid to seamlessly adapt from a single-column mobile view to a multi-column desktop experience.
* **📺 Retro Aesthetic:** Custom CSS implementation of vintage textures, sepia-toned image filters (that clear on hover), and period-appropriate typography.
* **🔗 Wikipedia Integration:** Each card includes a direct link to the historical Wikipedia entry for that specific model.
